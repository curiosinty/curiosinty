# Hello.

I'm an OSINT industry professional focused on continuous upskilling. I primarily focus on OSINT and cybersecurity.

**What is this Github for?**

This GitHub serves as a portfolio of learning, tooling, and applied projects across OSINT, cybersecurity, and programming (Python & SQL). I'll also put in CTF writeups from time to time.
